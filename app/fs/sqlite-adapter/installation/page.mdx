# Installation

## Requirements

- **Node.js 18** or later (this package is Node.js only)
- **@catmint-fs/core** installed as a peer dependency

`@catmint-fs/sqlite-adapter` uses [better-sqlite3](https://github.com/WiseLibs/better-sqlite3) under the hood, which includes a native C++ addon. The addon is prebuilt for most platforms, but you may need a C++ compiler available if a prebuild is not available for your OS/architecture combination.

## Install

```bash
npm install @catmint-fs/sqlite-adapter @catmint-fs/core
```

```bash
pnpm add @catmint-fs/sqlite-adapter @catmint-fs/core
```

```bash
yarn add @catmint-fs/sqlite-adapter @catmint-fs/core
```

## Verify

```typescript
import { SqliteAdapter } from "@catmint-fs/sqlite-adapter";

const adapter = new SqliteAdapter({ database: ":memory:" });
console.log(adapter.capabilities);
// { permissions: true, symlinks: true, caseSensitive: true }
```

If this runs without errors, the native addon compiled and loaded successfully.
