# Catmint Framework

A strongly-typed, full-stack React framework built on Vite. Catmint provides
file-based routing, React Server Components, server functions, middleware,
layouts, caching, and deployment adapters — all with first-class TypeScript support.

## Features

- **File-based routing** with dynamic segments, catch-all routes, and route groups
- **React Server Components** with streaming SSR and client hydration
- **Server functions** via `createServerFn` with automatic client-side fetch compilation
- **Middleware** with onion-model execution and `inherit: false` boundaries
- **Layouts** that persist across sibling navigation with nested layout chains
- **Caching** with `cachedRoute`, `staticRoute`, and cache invalidation
- **API endpoints** with HTTP method handlers and typed parameters
- **Environment variables** with build-time enforcement of server/client boundaries
- **Head & metadata** via `<Head>` component and `generateMetadata` export
- **Error handling** with `ErrorBoundary`, status pages, and `statusResponse()`
- **Forms** with progressive enhancement and CSRF protection
- **Internationalization** with locale detection and routing strategies
- **Telemetry** via OpenTelemetry with `trace()` and structured logging
- **Security** with CSP generation, nonce injection, and CSRF tokens
- **Testing utilities** for pages, server functions, endpoints, and middleware
- **Deployment adapters** for Node.js, Vercel, and Cloudflare Workers
